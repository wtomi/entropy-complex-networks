Sampson network, part of the Koblenz Network Collection
===========================================================================

This directory contains the TSV and related files of the moreno_sampson network:

This directed network contains ratings between monks related to a crisis in a cloister (or monastery) in New English (USA) which lead to a departure of several of the monks. This dataset aggregates several available ratings ((dis)esteem, (dis)liking, positive/negative influence, praise/blame) into only one rating, which is positive if all original ratings were positive and negative if all original ratings were negative.  If there were mixed opinions the rating has the value 0. A node represents a monk and an edge between two monks shows that the left monk rated the right monk.


More information about the network is provided here:

Files: 
    meta.moreno_sampson -- Metadata about the network 
    out.moreno_sampson -- The adjacency matrix of the network in space separated values format, with one edge per line
      The meaning of the columns in out.moreno_sampson are: 
        First column: ID of from node 
        Second column: ID of to node
        Third column: edge weight
